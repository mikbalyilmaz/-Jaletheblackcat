"Jale the Black Cat" is a cinematic short-video project built with Python &amp; MoviePy. It layers voices, sound effects, and background music with dynamic on-screen texts. Featuring creative edits, smooth transitions, and intro-style captions, the video unfolds as a 37-second artistic storytelling piece.
