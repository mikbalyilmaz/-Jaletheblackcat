**"Jale the Black Cat"** is a cinematic short-video project crafted in Python using **MoviePy**.  
It layers custom voiceovers, repeated sound cues, and a background soundtrack with **smooth transitions** and **intro-style captions**. The video flows as an artistic 37-second story, looping into longer compositions (up to 1 minute).
